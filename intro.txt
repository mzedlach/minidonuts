            Sweet tooth? Look no further! 
            
            Donuts are made to order so they're always fresh!
            
            Come to the Mini-Donut stand to induldge your taste buds in the sweet delights we have to offer! On a cold or cool day, warm up your palette and soul with a freshly made donut glimmering with a topping of your choice. Enjoy strawberry, chocolate, or caramel drizzle. Or keep it simple with powder sugar alone! We also have vanilla sugar, cinnamon, and occasional 'guest' toppings.  
            
            In the mood for something a little more crunchy? Try our Torpedo Desert! This flakey, buttery pastry from Poland is filled with light and fluffy cream. 
            
            During the summer season, we also make soft serve ice cream. Have your pick of chocolate or vanilla with your choice of toppings. Stawberries with cream are also seasonally available. 
            
            Donuts and icecream are made, daily, from raw ingredients. No powders here!
